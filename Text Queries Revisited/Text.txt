The Printable interface is implemented by the print methods of the current page painter,
which is called by the printing system to render a page. When building a Pageable,
pairs of PageFormat instances and instances that implement this interface are used to describe each page.
The instance implementing Printable is called to print the page's graphics.
A Printable(..) may be set on a PrinterJob. When the client subsequently initiates printing by calling PrinterJob.print(..) control
is handed to the printing system until all pages have been printed. 
It does this by calling Printable.print(..) until all pages in the document have been printed. 
In using the Printable interface the printing commits to image the contents of a page whenever requested by the printing system.
The parameters to Printable.print(..) include a PageFormat which describes the printable area of the page, 
needed for calculating the contents that will fit the page, 
and the page index, which specifies the zero-based print stream index of the requested page.

For correct printing behaviour, the following points should be observed:
